# Gait-Parameter-Selection-with-Feature-Selection
Description:
Welcome to the "Gait Parameter Selection with Feature Selection". In the realm of gait analysis, selecting the most informative gait parameters is crucial for understanding and improving human locomotion. This project focuses on the systematic exploration of various feature selection methods to identify the most relevant gait parameters, contributing to more accurate and efficient gait analysis.

Key Objectives and Achievements:

1. Feature Selection Diversity: We have curated an extensive collection of feature selection methods, including filter, wrapper, and embedded techniques. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize their gait analysis pipelines.

2. Gait Parameter Dataset: To facilitate your experiments, we provide a rich dataset of gait parameters collected from a diverse set of subjects in various walking conditions. This dataset is carefully annotated, enabling you to conduct feature selection tests under different scenarios.

3. Method Comparisons: We systematically compare the performance of these feature selection methods, evaluating their ability to retain the most informative gait parameters while reducing dimensionality. The project offers insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different techniques.

4. Ease of Integration: We've structured the code in a way that makes it easy to integrate these feature selection methods into your own gait analysis projects. This ensures that you can seamlessly apply what you've learned from our work.
